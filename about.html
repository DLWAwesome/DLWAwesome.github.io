  <p>IT'S A COIN COLLECTOR!!!</p>
  <p>I began coding on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/dlwawesome">Scratch</a>, but wanted to extend my skills beyond blockly. I came to <a href="https://github.com/dlwawesome">Github</a> seeking better forms of code, but could not find anything to learn. I went to code.org to learn code, and finally found my destination. I went back to <a href="https://github.com/dlwawesome">Github</a> to practice and test my newfound skills.</p>
